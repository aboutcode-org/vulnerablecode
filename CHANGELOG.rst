Release notes
=============

Version v30.0.0
----------------

- We refactored the core processing with Importers that import data and Improvers that
  transform imported data and convert that in Vulnerabilities and Packages. Improvers can
  also improve and refine imported and existing data as well as enrich data using external
  data sources. The migration to this new architecture is under way and not all importers
  are available. You can track the progress in this issue: https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode/issues/597 
  Because of these extensive changes, it is not possible to migrate existing imported
  data to the new schema. You will need instead to restart imports from an empty database
  or request access to the new vulnerablecode.io live instance.

- We added new data sources including PYSEC, GitHub and GitLab.

- We improved the documentation including adding development examples for importers and improvers.

- We removed the ability to edit relationships from the UI. The UI is now read-only
  and we will need to design a different UI for proper review and curation of vulnerabilities.

- We added support for NixOS as a Linux deployment target.

- The aliases of a vulnerabily are reported in the API vulnerabilities/ endpoint


- There are breaking Changes at API level with changes in the data structure:

  - in the /api/vulnerabilities/ endpoint:

    - Rename `resolved_packages` to `fixed_packages` 
    - Rename `unresolved_packages` to `affected_packages`
    - Rename `url` to `reference_url` in the reference list

  - in the /api/packages/ endpoint:

    - Rename `unresolved_vulnerabilities` to `affected_by_vulnerabilities`
    - Rename  `resolved_vulnerabilities` to `fixing_vulnerabilities`
    - Rename `url` to `reference_url` in the reference list

- We have provided backward compatibility for `url` and `unresolved_vulnerabilities` for now

- There is a new experimental cpe/ API endpoint to lookup for vulnerabilities by CPE and 
  another aliases/ endpoint to lookup for vulnerabilities by aliases. These two endpoints will be
  replaced by query parameters on the main vulnerabilities/ endpoint when stabilized.


Other:

- we dropped calver to use a plain semver.
- we adopted vers and the new univers library to handle version ranges.


Version v20.10
---------------

This release comes with the new calver versioning scheme and an initial data dump.
