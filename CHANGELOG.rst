Version v31.1.1
---------------

- We re-enabled support for the Apache HTTPD security advisories importer.
- We now support incomplete versions for a valid purl in search. For example,
  you can now search for ``pkg:nginx/nginx@1`` and get all versions of nginx
  starting with ``1``.


Version v31.1.0
----------------

- We re-enabled support for the NPM vulnerabilities advisories importer.
- We re-enabled support for the Retiredotnet vulnerabilities advisories importer.
- We are now handling purl fragments in package search. For example:
  you can now serch using queries in the UI like this : ``cherrypy@2.1.1``,
  ``cherrypy`` or ``pkg:pypi``.
- We are now ingesting npm advisories data through GitHub API.


Version v31.0.0
----------------

- We added a new Vulntotal command line tool that can compare the vulnerabilities
  between multiple vulnerability databases.

- We refactored how we handle CVSS scores. We are no longer storing a CVSS
  score separately from a CVSS vector. Instead the vector is stored in the
  scoring_elements field.

- We re-enabled support for the PostgreSQL securities advisories importer.

- We fixed the API key request form UI and made it consistent with rest of UI.

- We made bulk search faster by pre-computing `package_url` and
  `plain_package_url` in Package model.  And provided two options in package
  bulk search  ``purl_only`` option to get only vulnerable purls without any
  extra details, ``plain_purl`` option to filter purls without qualifiers and
  subpath and also return them without qualifiers and subpath. The names used
  are provisional and may be updated in a future release.


Version v30.3.1
----------------

This is a minor bug fix release.

- We enabled proper CSRF configuration for deployments


Version v30.3.0
----------------

This is a feature update release including minor bug fixes and the introduction
of API keys and API throttling.

- We enabled API throttling for a basic user and for a staff user
  they can have unlimited access on API.

- We added throttle rate for each API endpoint and it can be
  configured from the settings #991 https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode/issues/991

- We improved how we import NVD data
- We refactored and made the purl2cpe script work to dump purl to CPE mappings

Internally:

- We aligned key names internally with the names used in the UI and API (such as affected and fixed)
- We now use querysets as model managers and have streamlined view code


Version v30.2.1
----------------

- We refactored and fixed the LaunchPad API code.
- We now ignore qualifiers and subpath from PURL search lookups.
- We fixed severity table column spillover.


Version v30.2.0
----------------

This is a critical bug fix release including features updates.

- We fixed critical performance issues that made the web UI unusable. This include
  removing some less interesting redundant details displayed in the web UI for
  vulnerabilities.
- We made minor documentation updates.
- We re-enabled support for Arch linux, Debian, and Ubuntu security advisories importers
- We added a new improver for Oval data sources
- We improved Alpine linux and Gitlab security advisories importers

The summary of performance improvements include these fixes:

- Cascade queries from exact to approximate searches to avoid full table scans
  in all cases. This is a band-aid for now. The proper solution will likely
  require using full text search instead.
- Avoid iceberg queries with "prefetch related" to limit the number of queries
  that are needed in the UI
- Do not recreate querysets from scratch but instead allow these to be chained
  for simpler and correct code.
- Remove extra details from the vulnerability pacge: each package was further
  listing its related vulnerabilities creating an iceberg query.
- Enable the django-debug-toolbar with a setting to easily profile queries on demand
  by setting both VULNERABLECODE_DEBUG and VULNERABLECODE_DEBUG_TOOLBAR enviroment
  variables.


Version v30.1.1
----------------

- We added a new web UI link to explain how to obtain an API for the publicly
  hosted VulnerableCode


Version v30.1.0
----------------

- We added a new "/packages/all" API endpoint to get all Package URLs know to be vulnerable.


Version v30.0.0
----------------

This is a major version that is not backward compatible.

- We refactored the core processing with Importers that import data and Improvers that
  transform imported data and convert that in Vulnerabilities and Packages. Improvers can
  also improve and refine imported and existing data as well as enrich data using external
  data sources. The migration to this new architecture is under way and not all importers
  are available.

  Because of these extensive changes, it is not possible to migrate existing imported
  data to the new schema. You will need instead to restart imports from an empty database
  or access the new public.vulnerablecode.io live instance. We also provide a database dump.

- You can track the progress of this refactoring in this issue:
  https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode/issues/597

- We added new data sources including PYSEC, GitHub and GitLab.

- We improved the documentation including adding development examples for importers and improvers.

- We removed the ability to edit relationships from the UI. The UI is now read-only.

- We replaced the web UI with a brand new UI based on the same overall look and feel as ScanCode.io.

- We added support for NixOS as a Linux deployment target.

- The aliases of a vulnerabily are reported in the API vulnerabilities/ endpoint

- There are breaking Changes at API level with changes in the data structure:

  - in the /api/vulnerabilities/ endpoint:

    - Rename `resolved_packages` to `fixed_packages`
    - Rename `unresolved_packages` to `affected_packages`
    - Rename `url` to `reference_url` in the reference list
    - Add is_vulnerable property in fixed and affected_packages.

  - in the /api/packages/ endpoint:

    - Rename `unresolved_vulnerabilities` to `affected_by_vulnerabilities`
    - Rename  `resolved_vulnerabilities` to `fixing_vulnerabilities`
    - Rename `url` to `reference_url` in the reference list
    - Add new attribute `is_resolved`
    - Add namespace filter

- We have provided backward compatibility for `url` and `unresolved_vulnerabilities` for now.
  These will be removed in the next major version and should be considered as deprecated.

- There is a new experimental `cpe/` API endpoint to lookup for vulnerabilities by CPE and
  another aliases/ endpoint to lookup for vulnerabilities by aliases. These two endpoints will be
  replaced by query parameters on the main vulnerabilities/ endpoint when stabilized.

- We added filters for vulnerabilities endpoint to get fixed packages in accordance
  to the details given in filters: For example, when you call the endpoint this way
  ``/api/vulnerabilities?type=pypi&namespace=foo&name=bar``, you will receive only
  fixed versioned purls of the type ``pypi``, namespace ``foo`` and name ``bar``.

- Package endpoint will give fixed packages of only those that
  matches type, name, namespace, subpath and qualifiers of the package queried.

- Paginated initial listings to display a small number of records
  and provided page per size with a maximum limit of 100 records per page.

- Add fixed packages in vulnerabilities details in packages endpoint.

- Add bulk search support for CPEs.

- Add authentication for REST API endpoint.
  The autentication is disabled by default and can be enabled using the
  VULNERABLECODEIO_REQUIRE_AUTHENTICATION settings.
  When enabled, users have to authenticate using
  their API Key in the REST API.
  Users can be created using the Django "createsuperuser" management command.

- The data license is now CC-BY-SA-4.0 as this is the highest common
  denominator license among all the data sources we collect and aggregate.

Other:

- We dropped calver to use a plain semver.
- We adopted vers and the new univers library to handle version ranges.


Version v20.10
---------------

This release comes with the new calver versioning scheme and an initial data dump.
