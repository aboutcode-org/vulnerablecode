The What
--------

VulnerableCode is a FOSS database of vulnerabilities and the FOSS
packages they impact. It is made by the FOSS community to improve and
secure the open source software ecosystem.

The Why
-------

The existing solutions are commercial proprietary vulnerability
databases, which in itself does not make sense because the data is about
FOSS.

National Vulnerability Database which is the primary data source for all
things security, is not  particularly catered to address FOSS security
issues, because:

1. It predates the explosion of FOSS software usage
2. It's data format reflects  a commercial vendor-centric point of view,
   this is due to the usage of
   `CPE <https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe>`__ to map vulnerabilities
   and the packages.
3. CPEs are just not designed to map FOSS to vulnerabilities owing to
   their vendor-product centric semantics. This makes it really hard to
   answer the fundamental question "Is package foo vulnerable to
   vulnerability bar?"


The How
-------

VulnerableCode independently aggregates many software vulnerability data
sources that can easily be recreated in a decentralized fashion. These
data sources (see complete list `here <./SOURCES.rst>`_) include security
advisories published by distros, package managers, etc. Due to this, the
data obtained is not generalized to apply for other ecosystems. This
increases the accuracy as the same version of a package across different distros
may or may not be vulnerable to some vulnerability.

The packages are identified using
`PURL <https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec>`__ rather than CPEs.
This makes it really easy to answer questions like "Is package foo
vulnerable to vulnerability bar ? ".

The web interface enables community curation of data by enabling
the addition of new packages, vulnerabilities, and modifying the
relationships between them as shown in GIF. Along with the web interface
the API allows seamless consumption of the data.

We also plan to mine for vulnerabilities which didn't receive any
exposure due to various reasons like but not limited to the complicated
procedure to receive CVE ID or not able to classify a bug as a security
compromise.

Setting up VulnerableCode
-------------------------

Clone the source code:

::

    git clone https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode.git
    cd vulnerablecode

Using Docker Compose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An easy way to set up VulnerableCode is with docker containers and
docker compose. For this you need to have the following installed.

- Docker Engine. Find instructions to install it `here <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`__ 
- Docker Compose. Find instructions to install it `here <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose>`__

Use ``sudo docker-compose up`` to start VulnerableCode. Access
VulnerableCode at http://localhost:8000/ or at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ .

Use ``sudo docker-compose exec web bash`` to access the VulnerableCode
container. From here you can access ``manage.py`` and run management
commands to import data as specified below.

Without Docker Compose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**System requirements**

-  Python 3.8+
-  PostgreSQL 9+
-  Compiler toolchain and development files for Python and PostgreSQL

On Debian-based distros, these can be installed with
``sudo apt install python3-venv python3-dev postgresql libpq-dev build-essential``.

**Database configuration** - Create a user named ``vulnerablecode``. Use
``vulnerablecode`` as password when prompted:
``sudo -u postgres createuser --no-createrole --no-superuser --login --inherit --createdb --pwprompt vulnerablecode``

-  Create a databased named ``vulnerablecode``:
   ``createdb --encoding=utf-8 --owner=vulnerablecode  --user=vulnerablecode --password --host=localhost --port=5432 vulnerablecode``

**Application dependencies**

Create a virtualenv, install dependencies, and run the database
migrations:

::

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    DJANGO_DEV=1 python manage.py migrate

The environment variable ``DJANGO_DEV`` is used to load settings
suitable for development, defined in ``vulnerablecode/dev.py``. If you
don't want to type it every time use ``export DJANGO_DEV=1`` instead.

When not running in development mode, an environment variable named
``SECRET_KEY`` needs to be set. The recommended way to generate this key
is to use the code Django includes for this purpose:
``SECRET_KEY=$(python -c "from django.core.management import utils; print(utils.get_random_secret_key())")``.

Using Nix
~~~~~~~~~

You can install VulnerableCode with `Nix <https://nixos.org/download.html>`__ (`Flake <https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes>`__ support is needed).

::

    cd etc/nix
    nix --print-build-logs flake check # build & run tests

There are several options to use the Nix version

::

    # Enter an interactive environment with all dependencies set up.
    cd etc/nix
    nix develop
    > ../../manage.py ... # invoke the local checkout
    > vulnerablecode-manage.py ... # invoke manage.py as installed in the nix store

    # Test the import prodecure using the Nix version.
    etc/nix/test-import-using-nix.sh --all # import everything
    # Test the import using the local checkout.
    INSTALL_DIR=. etc/nix/test-import-using-nix.sh ruby # import ruby only


**Keeping the Nix setup in sync**

The Nix installation uses `mach-nix <https://github.com/DavHau/mach-nix>`__ to handle Python dependencies because some dependencies are currently not available as Nix packages.
All Python dependencies are automatically fetched from ``./requirements.txt``.
If the ``mach-nix``-based installation fails, you might need to update ``mach-nix`` itself and the `pypi-deps-db <https://github.com/DavHau/pypi-deps-db>`_ version in use (see ``etc/nix/flake.nix:inputs.machnix`` and ``machnixFor.pypiDataRev``).

Non-Python dependencies are curated in ``etc/nix/flake.nix:vulnerablecode.propagatedBuildInputs``.


Tests
-----

::

    pycodestyle --exclude=migrations,settings.py,venv,lib_oval.py,test_ubuntu.py,test_suse.py,test_data_source.py --max-line-length=100 .
    DJANGO_DEV=1 pytest

Data import
-----------

Many data importers use GitHub APIs. For this, first set up value of the ``GH_TOKEN`` environment variable by running :

::

    export GH_TOKEN=yourgithubtoken


See `GitHub docs  <https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token>`_ for instructions on how to obtain your GitHub token.


To run all data importers use :
::

    DJANGO_DEV=1 python manage.py import --all

To list available importers use :
::

    DJANGO_DEV=1 python manage.py import --list

To run specific importers :
::

    DJANGO_DEV=1 python manage.py import rust npm 


If you want to run the import periodically, you can use a systemd timer:

::

    $ cat ~/.config/systemd/user/vulnerablecode.service

    [Unit]
    Description=Update vulnerability database

    [Service]
    Type=oneshot
    Environment="DJANGO_DEV=1"
    ExecStart=/path/to/venv/bin/python /path/to/vulnerablecode/manage.py import --all

    $ cat ~/.config/systemd/user/vulnerablecode.timer

    [Unit]
    Description=Periodically update vulnerability database

    [Timer]
    OnCalendar=daily

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

Start it with

::

    systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user start vulnerablecode.timer

API
---

Start the webserver

::

    DJANGO_DEV=1 python manage.py runserver

In your browser access:

::

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs
