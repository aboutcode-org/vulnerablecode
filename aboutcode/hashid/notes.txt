cluster (name for a data kind)
repo (name with a kind, type, and PURL-based hash)
    -> directory name (kind, type, and PURL-based hash)
        -> PURL ns/name/version (no ns segment if this does not apply)
            -> PURL qualifiers+subpath

        	cluster_prefix: purls
        	data_kind: purls
        	data_filename: purls.yml
        	# hash length
        	max_number_of_directories: 1024
            number_of_repos_by_type:
               - default: 1
               - npm: 2
               - github: 4
