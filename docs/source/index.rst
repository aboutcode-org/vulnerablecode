Welcome to VulnerableCode!
=============================

*VulnerableCode* provides an open database of software packages that are affected
by known security vulnerabilities aka. *"vulnerable packages"*.

VulnerableCode is also a free and open source software (FOSS) project that
provides the tools to build this open database. The tools handle collecting,
aggregating and correlating these vulnerabilities and relating them to a correct
package version. Our project also supports a public cloud instance of this
database - VulnerableCode.io.

In this documentation you will find information on:

- An overview of VulnerableCode and what you can do with it
- Installation instructions
- How to make technical contributions to the project and the community
