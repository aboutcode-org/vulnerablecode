VulnerableCode Overview
=======================

*VulnerableCode* provides an open database of software packages that are affected
by known security vulnerabilities aka *"vulnerable packages"*.

VulnerableCode is also a free and open source software (FOSS) project that
provides the tools to build this open database. The tools handle collecting,
aggregating and correlating these vulnerabilities and relating them to a correct
package version. Our project also supports a public cloud instance of this
database - `VulnerableCode.io <https://public.vulnerablecode.io/>`__.


What can I do with VulnerableCode?
----------------------------------

**For security researchers and software developers, VulnerableCode offers a web
UI and a JSON API to efficiently find if the FOSS packages and dependencies that
you use are affected by known vulnerabilities and to determine whether a later package version
fixes those vulnerabilities.**


- With the web UI, you can search by package using Package URLs or search by
  vulnerability, e.g., by CVE. From there you can navigate to the package
  vulnerabilities and to the vulnerable packages.

- With the JSON API, you can perform package queries using Package URLs (`purl
  <https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec>`__) or query
  by vulnerability id ("VCID"). You can also query by CPEs and other vulnerability aliases.
  The API provides paginated index and detail endpoints and includes indexes
  of vulnerable CPEs and vulnerable Package URLs.

You can install VulnerableCode locally or use the provided publicly hosted instance,
or host your own installation. You can contact the VulnerableCode team
for special needs including commercial support.


Why VulnerableCode?
-------------------

VulnerableCode provides open correlated data and will support curated
data. Our approach is to prioritize upstream data sources and to merge multiple
vulnerability data sources after comparison and correlation. The vulnerability
data is keyed by Package URL ensuring quick and accurate lookup with minimal
friction. We continuously validate and refine the collected data for
quality, accuracy and consistency using "improver" jobs.
An example is an improver that can validate that a package version reported as
vulnerable actually exists (some do not exist). Another example is to re-evaluate
vulnerable version ranges based on the latest releases of a
package.

The benefit of our approach is that we will eventually provide better, more
accurate vulnerability data for packages reported in an SBOM.
This should contribute to more efficient vulnerability
management with less noise from false positives.

Another key reason why we created VulnerableCode is that
existing vulnerability database solutions are primarily commercial
or proprietary. This does not make sense because the bulk of the vulnerability
data is about FOSS.

The National Vulnerability Database, which is a primary centralized data
source for known vulnerabilities, is not particularly well suited to
address FOSS security issues because:

1. It predates the explosion of FOSS software usage
2. Its data format reflects a commercial vendor-centric point of view in part
   due to the usage of `CPEs <https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe>`__ to map
   vulnerabilities to existing packages.
3. CPEs were not designed to map FOSS to vulnerabilities owing to their
   vendor-product centric semantics. This makes it really hard to answer the
   fundamental questions: "Is package *foo* vulnerable?" and "Is package *foo*
   vulnerable to vulnerability *bar*?"

How does it work?
-----------------

VulnerableCode independently aggregates many software vulnerability data sources
and supports data re-creation in a decentralized fashion. These data sources
(see complete list
`here <https://vulnerablecode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/importers_link.html#importers-link>`__)
include security advisories published by Linux and BSD distributions,
application software package managers and package repositories, FOSS projects,
GitHub and more. Thanks to this approach, the data is focused on specific ecosystems and
aggregated in a single database that enables querying a richer graph of relations between multiple
representations of a package. Being specific increases the accuracy and validity
of the data as the same version of an upstream package across different
ecosystems may or may not be subject to the same vulnerability.

In VulnerableCode, packages are identified using Package URL (`purl
<https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec>`__) as the primary identifier instead of
a CPE. This makes answers to questions such as "Is package *foo* vulnerable
to vulnerability *bar*?" more accurate and easier to interpret.

The primary access to VulnerableCode data is through a REST API, but there
is also a Web UI for searching and browsing vulnerabilities by package
or by vulnerability. For the initial releases both access modes are
read-only, but our longer-term goal is to enable community curation of
the data including addition of new packages and vulnerabilities, and
reviewing and updating their relationships.

We also plan to mine for vulnerabilities that have not received any
exposure due to reasons such as the complicated
procedure to obtain a CVE ID or not being able to classify a bug as a vulnerability.
