    The ImportRunner is responsible for inserting and updating data about vulnerabilities and

    are correctness and efficiency.

    Correctness:
        - There must be no duplicates in the database (should be enforced by the schema).
        - No valid data from the data source must be skipped or truncated.

    Efficiency:
        - Bulk inserts should be used whenever possible.
        - Checking whether a record already exists should be kept to a minimum
        (the data source should know this instead).
        - All update and select operations must use indexed columns.
