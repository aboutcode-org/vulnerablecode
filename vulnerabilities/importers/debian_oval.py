    Subject: Usage of Debian Security Data in VulnerableCode
    To: <team@security.debian.org>
    Hey,
    We would like to integrate the debian security data in vulnerablecode
    [1][2] which is a FOSS db of FOSS vulnerability data. We were not able
    to know under which license the debian security data comes. We would
    be grateful to have your acknowledgement over usage of the debian
    security data in vulnerablecode and have some kind of licensing
    declaration from your side.
    [1] - https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode
    [2] - https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode/pull/723
    Regards,
    From: Moritz MÃ¼hlenhoff <jmm@inutil.org>

    We don't have a specific license, but you have our endorsemen to
    reuse the data by all means :-)
