            <p><i>Note: The issues below were fixed in Apache Tomcat 9.0.42 but the
                    release vote for the 9.0.42 release candidate did not pass. Therefore,
                    although users must download 9.0.43 to obtain a version that includes a
                    fix for these issues, version 9.0.42 is not included in the list of
                    affected versions.</i></p>

            <p>This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security team by Trung Pham
                of Viettel Cyber Security on 12 January 2021. The issue was made public
                on 1 March 2021.</p>

            <p>Affects: 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.41</p>

            </p>

            <p>When responding to new h2c connection requests, Apache Tomcat could
                duplicate request headers and a limited amount of request body from one
                request to another meaning user A and user B could both see the results of
                user A's request.</p>

            <p>This was fixed with commit

            <p><strong>Important: Remote Code Execution via session persistence</strong>

            <p>If:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>an attacker is able to control the contents and name of a file on the
                    server; and</li>
                <li>the server is configured to use the <code>PersistenceManager</code>
                    with a <code>FileStore</code>; and</li>
                <li>the <code>PersistenceManager</code> is configured with
                    <code>sessionAttributeValueClassNameFilter="null"</code> (the default
                    unless a <code>SecurityManager</code> is used) or a sufficiently lax
                    filter to allow the attacker provided object to be deserialized;
                    and
                </li>
                <li>the attacker knows the relative file path from the storage location
                    used by <code>FileStore</code> to the file the attacker has control
                    over;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>then, using a specifically crafted request, the attacker will be able to
                trigger remote code execution via deserialization of the file under their
                control.</p>

            <p><strong>Note:</strong> All of conditions above must be true for the
                attack to succeed.</p>

            <p>As an alternative to upgrading to 9.0.35 or later, users may configure
                the <code>PersistenceManager</code> with an appropriate value for
                <code>sessionAttributeValueClassNameFilter</code> to ensure that only
                application provided attributes are serialized and deserialized.

            </p>

            <p>Apache Tomcat uses a package renamed copy of Apache Commons FileUpload to
                implement the file upload requirements of the Servlet specification. A
                denial of service vulnerability was identified in Commons FileUpload that
                occurred when the length of the multipart boundary was just below the
                size of the buffer (4096 bytes) used to read the uploaded file. This
                caused the file upload process to take several orders of magnitude
                longer than if the boundary was the typical tens of bytes long.</p>

                4.1.x are advised to use the default, supported Coyote HTTP/1.1 connector
