title: "Introspection in schema validation in Apollo Server"
description: "If `subscriptions: false` is passed to the `ApolloServer` constructor
  options, there is no impact. If implementors were not expecting validation rules
  to be enforced on the WebSocket subscriptions transport **and** are unconcerned
  about introspection being enabled on the WebSocket subscriptions transport (or were
  not expecting that), then this advisory is not applicable. If `introspection: true`
  is passed to the `ApolloServer` constructor options, the impact is limited to user-provided
  validation rules (i.e., using `validationRules`) sinceÂ there would be no expectation
  that introspection was disabled."
