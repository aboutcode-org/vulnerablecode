<p><strong>Title:</strong> DNS-over-HTTPS implementation suffers from multiple issues under heavy query load</p>
<p><strong>Document version:</strong> 2.0</p>
<p><strong>Posting date:</strong> 29 January 2025</p>
<p><strong>Program impacted:</strong> <a href="https://www.isc.org/bind/">BIND 9</a></p>
<p><strong>Versions affected:</strong></p>
<p>BIND</p>
<ul>
<li>9.18.0 -&gt; 9.18.32</li>
<li>9.20.0 -&gt; 9.20.4</li>
<li>9.21.0 -&gt; 9.21.3</li>
</ul>
<p>(Versions prior to 9.18.27 were not assessed.)</p>
<p>BIND Supported Preview Edition</p>
<ul>
<li>9.18.11-S1 -&gt; 9.18.32-S1</li>
</ul>
<p>(Versions prior to 9.18.27-S1 were not assessed.)</p>
<p><strong>Severity:</strong> High</p>
<p><strong>Exploitable:</strong> Remotely</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>Clients using DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) can exhaust a DNS resolver's CPU and/or memory by flooding it with crafted valid or invalid HTTP/2 traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong></p>
<p>By flooding a target resolver with HTTP/2 traffic and exploiting this flaw, an attacker could overwhelm the server, causing high CPU and/or memory usage and preventing other clients from establishing DoH connections. This would significantly impair the resolver's performance and effectively deny legitimate clients access to the DNS resolution service.</p>
