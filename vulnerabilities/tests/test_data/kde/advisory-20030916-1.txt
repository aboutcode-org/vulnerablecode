1. Systems affected:

        All versions of KDM as distributed with KDE up to and including
        KDE 3.1.3.


2. Overview:

        Two issues have been discovered in KDM:

            a) CAN-2003-0690:
               Privilege escalation with specific PAM modules
            b) CAN-2003-0692:
               Session cookies generated by KDM are potentially insecure


3. Impact:

        If KDM is used in combination with the MIT pam_krb5 module and given
        a valid username and password of an existing user, the login attempt
        succeeds and establishes a session with excessive privileges.


4. Solution:

        Users of KDE 3.1.x are advised to upgrade to KDE 3.1.4.
