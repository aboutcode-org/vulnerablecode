title: Changing position:relative to static corrupts memory
---

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Dynamically changing the style of an element from position:relative
to position:static can cause Gecko to operate on freed memory.
It may be possible to exploit this in order to run arbitrary
code.</p>

<p>This flaw was introduced during Firefox 1.5 and SeaMonkey 1.0
development and does not affect Firefox 1.0 or the Mozilla Suite 1.7</p>

<p class="note">Thunderbird 1.5 could be vulnerable if JavaScript is
enabled in mail. This is not the default setting and we strongly
discourage users from turning on JavaScript in mail. Thunderbird
is not vulnerable in its default configuration.</p>

<p><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Update (13 April 2006)</strong><br/>
This flaw has been fixed in Thunderbird 1.5.0.2</p>

<h3>Workaround</h3>

<p>Upgrade to the fixed versions. Do not enable JavaScript in Thunderbird
or SeaMonkey mail.</p>
