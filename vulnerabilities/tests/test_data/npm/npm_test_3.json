    "overview": "Version of `kerberos` prior to 1.0.0 are vulnerable to DLL Injection. The package loads DLLs without specifying a full path. This may allow attackers to create a file with the same name in a folder that precedes the intended file in the DLL path search. Doing so would allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the machine.",
