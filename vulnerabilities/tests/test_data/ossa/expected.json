    "summary": "Unauthorized volume access through deleted volume attachments\n\nAn unauthorized access to a volume could occur when an iSCSI or FC\nconnection from a host is severed due to a volume being unmapped on\nthe storage system and the device is later reused for another volume\non the same host.\n\n**Scope:** Only deployments with iSCSI or FC volumes are affected.\nHowever, the fix for this issue includes a configuration change in\nNova and Cinder that may impact you on your next upgrade regardless\nof what backend storage technology you use. See the *Configuration\nchange* section below, and item 4(B) in the *Patches and Associated\nDeployment Changes* for details.\n\nThis data leak can be triggered by two different situations.\n\n**Accidental case:** If there is a problem with network connectivity\nduring a normal detach operation, OpenStack may fail to clean the\nsituation up properly. Instead of force-detaching the compute node\ndevice, Nova ignores the error, assuming the instance has already\nbeen deleted. Due to this incomplete operation OpenStack may end up\nselecting the wrong multipath device when connecting another volume\nto an instance.\n\n**Intentional case:** A regular user can create an instance with a\nvolume, and then delete the volume attachment directly in Cinder,\nwhich neglects to notify Nova. The compute node SCSI plumbing (over\niSCSI/FC) will continue trying to connect to the original\nhost/port/LUN, not knowing the attachment has been deleted. If a\nsubsequent volume attachment re-uses the host/port/LUN for a\ndifferent instance and volume, the original instance will gain\naccess to it once the SCSI plumbing reconnects.\n\nConfiguration Change\n--------------------\nTo prevent the intentional case, the Block Storage API provided by\nCinder must only accept attachment delete requests from Nova for\ninstance-attached volumes. A complicating factor is that Nova\ndeletes an attachment by making a call to the Block Storage API on\nbehalf of the user (that is, by passing the user's token), which\nmakes the request indistinguishable from the user making this\nrequest directly. The solution is to have Nova include a service\ntoken along with the user's token so that Cinder can determine that\nthe detach request is coming from Nova. The ability for Nova to pass\na service token has been supported since Ocata, but has not been\nrequired until now. Thus, deployments that are not currently sending\nservice user credentials from Nova will need to apply the relevant\ncode changes and also make configuration changes to solve the\nproblem.\n\nPatches and Associated Deployment Changes\n-----------------------------------------\nGiven the above analysis, a thorough fix must include the following\nelements:\n\n1. The os-brick library must implement the ``force`` option for\n   fibre channel, which which has only been available for iSCSI\n   until now (covered by the linked patches).\n\n2. Nova must call os-brick with the ``force`` option when\n   disconnecting volumes from deleted instances (covered by the\n   linked patches).\n\n3. In deployments where Glance uses the cinder glance_store driver,\n   glance must call os-brick with the ``force`` option when\n   disconnecting volumes (covered by the linked patches).\n\n4. Cinder must distinguish between safe and unsafe attachment delete\n   requests and reject the unsafe ones. This part of the fix has two\n   components:\n\n   a. The Block Storage API will return a 409 (Conflict) for a\n      request to delete an attachment if there is an instance\n      currently using the attachment, **unless** the request is\n      being made by a service (for example, Nova) on behalf of a\n      user (covered by the linked patches).\n\n   b. In order to recognize that a request is being made by a\n      service on behalf of a user, Nova must be configured to send a\n      service token along with the user token. If this configuration\n      change is not made, the cinder change will reject **any**\n      request to delete an attachment associated with a volume that\n      is attached to an instance. Nova must be configured to send a\n      service token to Cinder, and Cinder must be configured to\n      accept service tokens. This is described in the following\n      document and **IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY APPLIED BY THE LINKED\n      PATCHES:** (Using service tokens to prevent long-running job\n      failures)\n      https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest/configuration/block-storage/service-token.html\n      The Nova patch mentioned in step 2 includes a similar document\n      more focused on Nova:\n      doc/source/admin/configuration/service-user-token.rst\n\n5. The cinder glance_store driver does not attach volumes to\n   instances; instead, it attaches volumes directly to the Glance\n   node. Thus, the Cinder change in step 4 will recognize an\n   attachment-delete request coming from Glance as safe and allow\n   it. (Of course, we expect that you will have applied the patches\n   in steps 1 and 3 to your Glance nodes.)",
