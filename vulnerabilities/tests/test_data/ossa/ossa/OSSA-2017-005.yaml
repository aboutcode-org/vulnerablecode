title: Nova Filter Scheduler bypass through rebuild action

description: >
  George Shuklin from servers.com reported a vulnerability in Nova. By
  rebuilding an instance, an authenticated user may be able to circumvent the
  Filter Scheduler bypassing imposed filters (for example, the
  ImagePropertiesFilter or the IsolatedHostsFilter).
  All setups using Nova Filter Scheduler are affected.

errata: >
  The former fix introduced regressions in the rebuild functionality.
  Rebuild may fail depending on configured scheduler filters and environment,
  for example, when the compute host is running at capacity or when the host
  is disabled.
  This update provides an additional set of fixes for these regressions.
