title: Open Redirect in noVNC proxy

description: >
  Swe Aung, Shahaan Ayyub, and Salman Khan with the Monash University Cyber
  Security team reported a vulnerability affecting Nova's noVNC proxying
  implementation which exposed access to a well-known redirect behavior in the
  Python standard library's http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler and thus
  noVNC's WebSockifyRequestHandler which uses it. By convincing a user to
  follow a specially-crafted novncproxy URL, the user could be redirected to an
  unrelated site under control of the attacker in an attempt to convince them
  to divulge credentials or other sensitive data. All Nova deployments with
  novncproxy enabled are affected.

errata: >
  The initial fix did not take into account the possibility of bypass using
  exactly three slashes. This update provides a more thorough revised fix for
  the issue. The affected versions list has been updated to indicate versions
  expected to include the newer solution.
