title: Unauthenticated access to EC2/S3 token endpoints can grant Keystone authorization

description: >
  kay reported a vulnerability in Keystone’s ec2tokens and s3tokens APIs. By
  sending those endpoints a valid AWS Signature (e.g., from a presigned S3
  URL), an unauthenticated attacker may obtain Keystone authorization
  for the user associated with the signature
  (ec2tokens can yield a fully scoped token; s3tokens can reveal scope accepted
  by some services), resulting in unauthorized access and privilege escalation.
  Deployments where /v3/ec2tokens or /v3/s3tokens are reachable by
  unauthenticated clients (e.g., exposed on a public API) are affected.

  CVE-2025-65073 was assigned by MITRE after publication based on a request
  submitted 2025-09-24 (months prior); if any other CNA has assigned a CVE
  themselves in the meantime, please reject it so that we don't end up with
  duplicates. Further, the description has been extended to clarify token
  ownership. Backported fixes for the unmaintained/2024.1 branches are now
  included.

notes:
  - While the indicated Keystone patches are sufficient to mitigate this
    vulnerability, corresponding changes for Swift are included which keep its
    optional S3-like API working.
  - The unmaintained/2024.1 branches will receive no new point releases, but
    patches for them are provided as a courtesy.
