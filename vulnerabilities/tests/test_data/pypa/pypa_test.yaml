id: PYSEC-2022-1
details: An issue was discovered in Django 2.2 before 2.2.26, 3.2 before 3.2.11, and
  4.0 before 4.0.1. UserAttributeSimilarityValidator incurred significant overhead
  in evaluating a submitted password that was artificially large in relation to the
  comparison values. In a situation where access to user registration was unrestricted,
  this provided a potential vector for a denial-of-service attack.
